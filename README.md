## ✨ What is this project?

This is **My Bracelets Shop** — a simple and sweet web app where users can sign up, log in, browse beautiful handmade bracelets, add their favorites to a shopping cart, and place orders!

I built this project to learn how to create interactive apps with Python’s **Streamlit** and to practice working with databases, user login systems, and shopping carts.
